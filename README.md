# Expense Tracker

## Overview

The Expense Tracker is a Java program designed for managing personal finances by tracking income and expenses. This program was developed as a second-year computer engineering assignment. It employs various data structures and provides a text-based user interface for interacting with the application.

## Features

1. **Transaction Management:**
   - Credit and debit transactions can be recorded with details such as amount, description, category, and date.
   - Predefined categories include "food," "transport," "shopping," "salary," and "entertainment."

2. **Account Balances:**
   - The program maintains account balances, updating them based on recorded transactions.

3. **Transaction Viewing:**
   - Users can view their transactions either for a specific account or by category.
   - Transactions are sorted by date for easy reference.

4. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can create accounts or log in to existing ones to track their transactions separately.

5. **Menu Interface:**
   - The program provides a user-friendly menu with ASCII art for a visually appealing experience.
   - Menu options include credit transactions, debit transactions, viewing transactions, viewing transactions by category, printing account balances, creating/logging in to an account, logging out, and exiting the program.

6. **Input Validation:**
   - The program validates inputs to ensure the correctness of data, including date formats and numeric values for transactions.
